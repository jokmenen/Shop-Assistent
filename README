# Shop Assistant
Trying to learn how to use agents by creating a virtual shopping assistant. The assistant is supposed to help you find the items you need and answer any questions you have about the products in the 'store'.
In the background, the agent is supposed to *plan* (what steps do i need to take to make the customer happy), *use tools* (i want to add a clothes fitting function), *remember* (what was the customer looking for again?) and take action.
